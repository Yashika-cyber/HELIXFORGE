## 1. Problem Statement & Objective

### Problem Statement

DNA sequencing machines do not read an entire genome in one pass. Instead, they produce millions of short overlapping fragments called **reads** (typically 75–300 base pairs long). The central challenge of **genome assembly** is to reconstruct the original, complete genomic sequence from these millions of short, noisy, overlapping fragments — a problem analogous to reassembling a shredded book when you have millions of copies of random overlapping excerpts.

This is computationally hard because:
- Reads contain sequencing errors (substitutions, insertions, deletions)
- The genome contains repetitive regions that appear in many places
- The volume of data is enormous (human genome ≈ 3 billion base pairs)
- Both strands of the DNA double helix are sequenced simultaneously

### Objective

Design and implement **HelixForge**, a complete genome assembly pipeline in C++ that:

1. **Ingests** raw sequencing data in FASTQ format
2. **Filters** erroneous k-mers using a Bloom filter (probabilistic data structure)
3. **Constructs** a De Bruijn graph from solid k-mers using a rolling hash
4. **Assembles** the genome using two complementary graph traversal strategies:
   - Hierholzer's Eulerian path algorithm (maximum edge coverage)
   - Dijkstra's shortest path with coverage weights (highest confidence path)
5. **Corrects** sequencing errors in the assembled sequence
6. **Analyses** repeats in the assembly using a Suffix Array and LCP Array
7. **Reports** bioinformatics-standard metrics: GC content, N50, repeat regions

## 4. Main Modules — Algorithms & Descriptions

### Module 1 — Reverse Complement (`rev_comp`)

**Purpose:** DNA is double-stranded. A sequencer can read either strand, so the same genomic region may appear as `ATCG` from one read and `CGAT` (its reverse complement) from another. Without canonicalization, these would create duplicate, conflicting graph nodes.

**Algorithm:**
```
rev_comp(s):
    r = ""
    for i from len(s)-1 down to 0:
        complement char: A↔T, C↔G
        append to r
    return r

canonical(kmer):
    return min(kmer, rev_comp(kmer))
```

**Effect:** Every k-mer and its reverse complement now map to the same canonical node, halving graph size and making the graph biologically correct.

---

### Module 2 — Rolling Hash (Rabin-Karp)

**Purpose:** Computing a fresh hash for every k-mer by scanning all k characters is O(k) per k-mer, giving O(Nk) total. Rolling hash reduces each slide to O(1).

**Algorithm:**
```
Polynomial hash:  H(s[i..i+k-1]) = s[i]·B^(k-1) + s[i+1]·B^(k-2) + ... + s[i+k-1]
                  (all mod a Mersenne prime 2^61 - 1)

Slide:  H(s[i+1..i+k]) = (H(s[i..i+k-1]) - s[i]·B^(k-1)) · B + s[i+k]

__uint128_t used for intermediate products to avoid overflow.
```

**Complexity:** O(k) initialisation, O(1) per subsequent slide.

---

### Module 3 — Bloom Filter (Dual-Filter Solid k-mer Detection)

**Purpose:** Remove singleton k-mers caused by sequencing errors. A k-mer seen only once is almost certainly an error, not a real genomic sequence.

**Algorithm:**
```
Two independent Bloom filters: once_BF, twice_BF
Each filter has BITS = 2^26 bits (~8 MB), 3 hash functions.

Insert k-mer hash h:
    IF h ∈ once_BF → insert h into twice_BF
    ELSE           → insert h into once_BF

Query solid: h ∈ twice_BF  (seen at least twice)

Hash function i: bit_pos = ((h XOR salt_i) * knuth_multiplier + offset) mod BITS
```

**False positive rate:** ≈ (1 - e^(-kn/m))^k ≈ 0.02% with k=3, n=10M, m=67M bits.

---

### Module 4 — De Bruijn Graph Construction

**Purpose:** The De Bruijn graph is the core data structure of the assembler. Each (k-1)-mer is a node; each k-mer creates a directed edge from its prefix to its suffix.

**Algorithm:**
```
For each solid k-mer km:
    canonical = min(km, rev_comp(km))
    u = canonical[0..k-2]   (left (k-1)-mer)
    v = canonical[1..k-1]   (right (k-1)-mer)
    adj[u].push_back(v)
    edge_freq["u->v"]++
    outdeg[u]++, indeg[v]++
```

**Key insight:** If a genome has an Eulerian path through its De Bruijn graph, that path spells out the assembled sequence. Euler's theorem guarantees this when every node has balanced in/out degrees.

---

### Module 5 — Dijkstra's Coverage-Weighted Assembly

**Purpose:** Find the highest-confidence assembly path. Edges supported by many reads are more likely to be real. By assigning low cost to high-frequency edges, Dijkstra naturally follows the most-covered route.

**Algorithm:**
```
max_f = max(edge_freq.values())

weight(u→v) = (max_f + 1) - edge_freq[u→v]
    ↑ high coverage = low weight = Dijkstra prefers it

Standard Dijkstra with min-heap (priority_queue, greater<>):
    dist[src] = 0, dist[all others] = ∞
    WHILE heap not empty:
        (d, u) = heap.pop_min()
        IF d > dist[u]: skip  ← lazy deletion of stale entries
        FOR each v in adj[u]:
            nd = d + weight(u→v)
            IF nd < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = nd
                prev[v] = u
                hops[v] = hops[u] + 1
                heap.push((nd, v))

Endpoint: prefer Eulerian sink (indeg - outdeg == 1);
          fallback to node with most hops.

Reconstruct via prev[] back-pointers → sequence.
```

**Complexity:** O((V + E) log V) with binary heap.

---

### Module 6 — Hierholzer's Eulerian Path

**Purpose:** If the De Bruijn graph has an Eulerian path (each node has balanced in/out degrees, at most two exceptions), Hierholzer's algorithm finds a path that traverses every edge exactly once — producing the longest possible assembly.

**Algorithm:**
```
stack.push(start_node)
WHILE stack not empty:
    v = stack.top()
    IF v has unused edges:
        stack.push(next_neighbour[v])
        idx[v]++
    ELSE:
        circuit.append(v)
        stack.pop()
reverse(circuit)

Stitch: seq = circuit[0]
        for i = 1 to len(circuit)-1:
            seq += circuit[i].back()
```

**Complexity:** O(E) — each edge is pushed and popped exactly once.

---

### Module 7 — DP Error Correction

**Purpose:** Sequencing errors often appear as isolated single-base substitutions. A base that disagrees with both its immediate neighbours is almost certainly a substitution error.

**Algorithm:**
```
FOR i = 1 to len(seq)-2:
    IF seq[i-1] == seq[i+1]   ← both neighbours agree
    AND seq[i] ≠ seq[i-1]     ← current base disagrees
        seq[i] = seq[i-1]     ← correct by majority vote
```

**Complexity:** O(N) single pass.  
**DP connection:** Each position's correction decision depends on previously visited positions — this is the optimal substructure property of dynamic programming applied to sequence smoothing.

---

### Module 8 — Suffix Array (Prefix-Doubling)

**Purpose:** The suffix array is the backbone of all string analytics in bioinformatics. It enables O(log n) pattern search, O(n) repeat detection, and is used in production aligners (BWA, Bowtie2).

**Algorithm (Manber & Myers prefix-doubling):**
```
SA  = [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]      (all suffix start positions)
rank[i] = (unsigned char) s[i]  (initial rank = ASCII value)

FOR gap = 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., n:
    Sort SA using comparator:
        key(i) = (rank[i], rank[i+gap])   (-1 if i+gap out of bounds)
    
    Recompute rank[]:
        rank[SA[0]] = 0
        rank[SA[j]] = rank[SA[j-1]] + (keys differ ? 1 : 0)
    
    IF rank[SA[n-1]] == n-1: BREAK   ← all suffixes uniquely ranked

Sentinel '$' (ASCII 36) appended before build:
    guarantees no two suffixes are identical.
```

**Complexity:** O(log n) doubling rounds × O(n log n) sort = **O(n log² n)** total.

**Why prefix-doubling works:** After round k, rank[] captures the relative order of all length-2^k prefixes. Comparing pairs (rank[i], rank[i+2^k]) gives the order of all length-2^(k+1) prefixes — doubling the resolved length each round.

---

### Module 9 — LCP Array (Kasai's Algorithm)

**Purpose:** The Longest Common Prefix (LCP) array stores the length of the longest common prefix between consecutive suffixes in the suffix array. It is essential for efficient repeat detection.

**Algorithm (Kasai 2001):**
```
Build inverse SA: rank[SA[i]] = i   for all i

h = 0   (current LCP value)
FOR i = 0 to n-1:
    IF rank[i] > 0:
        j = SA[rank[i] - 1]         ← SA-predecessor of suffix i
        WHILE s[i+h] == s[j+h]: h++ ← extend match
        lcp[rank[i]] = h
        IF h > 0: h--               ← key invariant: h drops by ≤ 1
```

**Key invariant:** When we move from suffix i to suffix i+1, the LCP with the SA-predecessor can decrease by at most 1. This means `h` is decremented at most n times total across all iterations → **O(n)** overall.

---

### Module 10 — Repeat Finder (LCP Scan)

**Purpose:** Repetitive DNA regions (transposons, telomeres, microsatellites) confuse assemblers and are biologically significant. The LCP array directly encodes shared prefix lengths, making repeat detection trivial.

**Algorithm:**
```
FOR i = 1 to n-1:
    IF lcp[i] >= min_len:
        Group consecutive entries where lcp[j] >= min_len
        group_lcp = min(lcp[i..j-1])   ← shared prefix of entire group
        Positions: SA[i-1], SA[i], ..., SA[j-1]
        Filter: only positions where pos + group_lcp ≤ seq_len (exclude sentinel)
        Record RepeatRegion{pattern, length, occurrences, positions}

Sort repeat regions by length descending.
```

**Complexity:** O(n) scan of the LCP array.

---

### Module 11 — Greedy Frequency-Weighted Fallback

**Purpose:** If neither Hierholzer nor Dijkstra produces output (highly fragmented graph), a greedy walk provides at least a partial assembly.

**Algorithm:**
```
cur = start_node
res = cur
WHILE cur has unvisited neighbours:
    best_nxt = neighbour v of cur with max edge_freq[cur→v]
               that has not been visited from cur
    res += best_nxt.back()
    cur = best_nxt
```

**Improvement over naive greedy:** Uses edge frequency to prefer the most-supported path at each step, instead of arbitrarily picking the first edge.

---

### Module 12 — Genome Metrics

**GC Content:**
```
gc_content(s) = 100 × |{c ∈ s : c ∈ {G, C}}| / |s|
```
GC content is a fundamental genome characteristic used to identify coding regions, species identity, and DNA stability (G-C pairs have 3 hydrogen bonds vs. A-T's 2).

**N50:**
```
1. Split assembly on 'N' gap characters → contig lengths c[0..m-1]
2. Sort c[] descending
3. Find smallest L such that sum of contigs ≥ L covers ≥ 50% of total assembly
4. N50 = L
```
N50 is the standard assembly quality metric: higher N50 = fewer, longer contigs = better assembly.

The Bloom filter / rolling hash dominate at 4.12 ms because they process every k-mer in every read — the graph work, Dijkstra, and SA+LCP are all sub-millisecond on this small dataset.

### Figure 3 — genome.fasta: Assembled Sequence in FASTA Format

```
>HelixForge_assembled_sequence method=Hierholzer (Eulerian)
CGATCGA
```

**What this showcases:**  
The assembled genome output in standard FASTA format (used by every bioinformatics tool in existence). The header line includes the assembly method used (`Hierholzer (Eulerian)`) for provenance. On larger datasets the sequence is wrapped at 60 characters per line following the FASTA standard. The sequence `CGATCGA` is the 7-bp assembly from the 3-read test (reads of `ATCGATCGATCGATCG`, `CGATCGATCGATCGAT`, `GATCGATCGATCGATC` with k=7).

```

**What this showcases:**  
The Suffix Array + LCP pipeline detecting tandem repeat units of the `ATCGATCG` motif at multiple lengths and positions. The table is sorted by repeat length (longest first). Each entry shows: the repeat length, how many times it occurs, the genomic positions where it starts, and a preview of the pattern. In real genomes, this output identifies transposons, microsatellites, and low-complexity regions that are known assembly pitfalls.

### Figure 5 — SA Correctness Verification (Unit Test Output)

```
repeat at pos 16 & 12  lcp=12
repeat at pos 12 & 8   lcp=16
repeat at pos 8  & 4   lcp=20
repeat at pos 4  & 0   lcp=24
repeat at pos 14 & 10  lcp=14
...
Total pairs with LCP>=12: 13
SA[0]=28 (suffix: $)
```

**What this showcases:**  
Internal verification of the Suffix Array and LCP Array on the string `ATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCG$` (12-bp unit repeated). The unit test confirms: (1) the sentinel `$` correctly sorts to SA position 0 (smallest suffix), (2) pairs of suffixes that share a 12-character prefix are found at exactly the correct positions, (3) LCP values increase as we look at longer shared prefixes (12, 16, 20, 24 for the repeating unit). This validates Kasai's algorithm implementation.

**What this showcases:**  
The De Bruijn graph exported as weighted JSON for the front-end visualiser. Each edge now carries a `weight` field equal to `edge_freq` — the number of reads that contained that k-mer transition. This weight is used directly by the Dijkstra module (high weight = low cost = preferred path). The front-end can render edge thickness proportional to weight, giving an immediate visual indication of which paths through the graph are best supported by the sequencing data.

## 8. Conclusion

HelixForge demonstrates that the core algorithms of a real-world genome assembler can be built from first principles using fundamental DAA concepts.

### What We Achieved

1. **Complete end-to-end pipeline** from raw FASTQ reads to assembled FASTA genome, running in under 5 ms on test data.

2. **Two complementary assembly strategies** — Hierholzer (maximum coverage) and Dijkstra (maximum confidence) — are both computed and the better result is used. This dual-strategy approach is novel compared to most textbook implementations.

3. **Bioinformatics-grade string analytics** — the Suffix Array + Kasai LCP implementation correctly identifies all repeat regions, verified against known tandem repeat sequences.

4. **Space efficiency** — the Bloom filter (~8 MB) replaces an exact hash set that would require hundreds of MB for realistic genomes, at a false-positive rate of < 0.02%.

5. **Correctness** — canonical k-mers (reverse complement handling) ensure both DNA strands are treated equivalently, matching the behaviour of production assemblers like SPAdes and Velvet.

### Complexity Summary

| Stage | Algorithm | Complexity |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| k-mer hashing | Rolling hash + Bloom filter | O(N) |
| Graph construction | Adjacency list | O(V + E) |
| Coverage-weighted assembly | Dijkstra + min-heap | O((V+E) log V) |
| Eulerian assembly | Hierholzer | O(E) |
| Error correction | DP sliding window | O(N) |
| Suffix array | Prefix doubling | O(n log² n) |
| LCP array | Kasai's algorithm | O(n) |
| Repeat detection | LCP scan | O(n) |
| **Overall** | — | **O(N + (V+E) log V + n log² n)** |

### Limitations & Future Work

- **Paired-end reads:** The current pipeline treats all reads as single-end. Paired-end reads provide long-range distance constraints that dramatically improve scaffolding of repeat regions.
- **Contig extraction:** The current implementation outputs one assembled sequence. A full assembler would extract individual unitigs (unbranched paths) as separate contigs.
- **Bubble/tip removal:** Sequencing errors create short dead-end "tips" and two-path "bubbles" in the De Bruijn graph. Removing these before traversal would improve assembly quality.
- **Parallelism:** The hashing stage is embarrassingly parallel — `std::thread` or OpenMP could distribute reads across cores for 4–8× speedup.
- **GFA output:** The Graphical Fragment Assembly format is the industry standard for graph visualisation tools like Bandage.

### Key Takeaways

> The genome assembly problem is a beautiful intersection of graph theory, string algorithms, probabilistic data structures, and dynamic programming — all of which are core DAA topics. HelixForge shows that a competitive implementation requires not just one algorithm but a carefully designed **pipeline** where each module's output feeds the next, with complexity trade-offs made deliberately at every stage.
